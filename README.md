# Asteroids Game!!!
This is the front-end of our Asteroid game clone. This contains all the JavaScript to run the game. The game communicates with a custom Rails API that holds users and game data for a leaderboard.

### Controls
The controls are W, A, D to move, and spacebar to shoot. As you progress in levels, the speed and number of asteroids increase. Survive for as long as you can.

### User Stories
As a user you can:
- Create a new user with a username
- Create a new game
- Create a new level upon destroying all asteroids on screen
- View previous games you've been in
- View all games on a leaderboard
- Update your username
- Delete previous games
- Delete your user profile
